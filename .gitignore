# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3

# IMPORTANT - Houses measure source files on load that cannot be released to github. Be careful.
/db/measures
/db/bundles
/db/*oids_by_measure.json
/db/code_sets

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# ignore coverage
coverage.data
coverage

# Ignore files left from unpacking zip files
.DS_Store
